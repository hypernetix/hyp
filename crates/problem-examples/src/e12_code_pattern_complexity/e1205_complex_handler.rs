/// E1205: Complex handler with nested trait bounds
/// Severity: MED
/// LLM confusion: 5 (HIGHEST)
///
/// Description: This code has extremely complex trait bounds with nested associated types and
/// multiple where clauses, making it nearly impossible to understand what types are actually
/// required. The trait bounds reference associated types of other traits, creating a web of
/// dependencies that's very hard to follow. It's like a function signature that requires "a type
/// that implements trait A, where A's associated type implements trait B, where B's output
/// implements trait C" - each layer adds cognitive load. Fix by simplifying the API, using
/// concrete types where possible, or breaking complex operations into smaller, simpler pieces.
///
/// Mitigation: Use `#![warn(clippy::type_complexity)]` to catch overly complex types. Limit
/// trait bounds to 2-3 per function. Consider using trait objects (`Box<dyn Trait>`) for
/// simpler signatures when performance isn't critical. Break complex generic functions into
/// smaller, more focused functions. Document what each bound actually means.

pub trait Rejection {}

// This function takes a handler (H) and a fallback function (F).
// H is a Handler trait that produces a Future (asynchronous operation).
// The 'where' clause has many constraints:
// - H::Output means "the Output associated type of the Handler trait"
// - Pin<Box<dyn Future<...>>> is a heap-allocated future that can't be moved
// - The handler must work with type T and error E, and both must be thread-safe (Send)
// - Even the output of the handler's output must be Send (nested constraint!)
// This creates layers upon layers of type requirements that are very hard to track.
