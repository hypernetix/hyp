/// E1212: Generic Associated Types (GATs) complexity
/// Severity: HIGH
/// LLM confusion: 5 (HIGHEST)
///
/// Description: Generic Associated Types (GATs) allow associated types to have their own generic
/// parameters, creating a very complex layer of abstraction. This means a trait can have an
/// associated type that itself is generic over some lifetime or type. This is extremely confusing
/// because you have generics within generics within traits. It's like having a template that
/// returns another template. Fix by simplifying the trait design or avoiding GATs when possible.
///
/// Mitigation: Avoid GATs unless absolutely necessary for your API. When needed, provide extensive
/// documentation and examples. Use concrete types in examples to show how GATs are meant to be used.
/// Consider if a simpler design without GATs would work.

// This trait is like an iterator, but with a twist - the Item type has its own generic parameter!
// Item<'a> means the type of Item depends on the lifetime 'a passed to it.
// This is a GAT (Generic Associated Type). Regular associated types don't have their own parameters.
// The where Self: 'a means the iterator must live at least as long as the items it produces.
//
// PROBLEM E1212: Generic Associated Type - associated type has its own generic parameter
